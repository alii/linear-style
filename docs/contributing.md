Hey! Thanks for contributing to linear-style. We'll try and
merge your PR as quick as possible. But before that, here's how you can add your own styles.

Firstly, on GitHub, head to [this file](https://github.com/alii/linear-style/blob/main/src/pages/api/themes.ts). This is where the themes are sourced from

Secondly, hit the pencil icon on the top right of the code editor. This will fork the repo to your personal account and then open up this file.

Third, add your theme in the object of themes. It should have the name of the theme (this **must** be unique) as the key, and the value should be the comma delimited value found in the linear settings page.

Finally, create a pull request and your theme will be merged in. Thanks for sharing!
